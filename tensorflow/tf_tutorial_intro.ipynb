    "### Why tensorflow?\n",
    "\n",
    "As of today (end of 2017), there are only two widely used, up to date deep learning frameworks: [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [pytorch](http://pytorch.org/). Both are python frameworks and follow similar design principles and functionality. In this course, we will be using tensorflow, as it is more mature and supported on more platforms. However, the main concepts carry over unmodified.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is tensorflow?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensorflow is a framework to define computations, automatically differentiate them and execute them in an efficient manner (potentially on GPUs). In order to do so, tensorflow splits the process of creating an algorithm into two steps: first *defining* the computation to be executed, and then running or *executing* the computation (on CPU or GPU).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing tensorflow\n",
    "\n",
    "For CPU, the installation is straightforward. We have provided an updated environment file. You may upgrade to that environment file by placing the environment file AdvML.yml in your working directory and running:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda env update -f AdvML.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish to install it directly into your environment, simply run `pip install tensorflow` with the environment activated."

    "## Defining the computation: dataflow graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensorflow uses the concepts of graphs `tf.Graph` to define the computation to be executed. The nodes in the graphs are operations, and data flows along the edges of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "![tensorflow graph example](https://www.tensorflow.org/images/tensors_flowing.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in creating a model will be defining the graph operations that correspond to the model. Tensorflow provides many convenience functions to define the nodes of the graphs, which are called *ops*."

    "\n",
    "### Placeholder\n",

    "\n",
    "Tensorflow defines numerous operation on tensors, including pointwise arithmetic, tensor dot product, convolutions, etc. Tensorflow also overloads the normal python operators, however be careful of the exact semantics of the overload if you do use them. Operation on tensors provide one or more tensors as output."
